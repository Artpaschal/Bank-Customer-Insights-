# 💼 Bank Customer Insights & Loan Analytics Dashboard

### A Power BI Storytelling Project uncovering customer behaviors, loan trends, and transaction insights to support data-driven decisions in banking.

# ✨ Overview

This project explores a bank's operational data to deliver actionable insights through a well-designed Power BI dashboard. It focuses on customer demographics, loan performance, transaction trends, and account balance distribution.

The goal was to clean and model raw datasets into a unified analytical model, then deliver intuitive visualizations that answer key business questions.

# 📄 Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following components:

Customer Info: Customer ID, Account No, Age, Sex, Occupation, City, Deposits

Accounts: Account Type, Opening Balance, Account Officer

Loans: Loan balances

Transactions: Transaction type, amount, medium, date, time

# 🔍 Key Business Questions Answered

What are the demographics of the bank’s customer base?

Which regions or age groups have higher loan uptake?

What is the loan repayment performance across different customer segments?

What are the peak transaction times, and which transaction types dominate?

How do account balances vary across different account types?
